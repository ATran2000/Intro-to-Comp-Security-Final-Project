About:  
Own implementation of Apple's AirDrop where you can securely send files to other clients on the server.  

Steps To Use Code:
1) First have the server.py file be in its own directory.
2) Next have the secure_drop.py file also be in its own directory.
3) Before starting any secure_drop.py program, first start the server.py program file by typing...
   	python server.py
4) Start the secure_drop.py program by typing...
	python secure_drop.py
5) If you want more than one client, have copies of the secure_drop.py program be in their own
   new directories and start the secure_drop.py programs using the previous step.
